				• <m>linear</m>: Gain described as linear amplitude. <br />
				• <m>midi</m>: In Jamoma MIDI gain is mapped so that MIDI=0 equals linear amplitude of 0, MIDI=100 equals unity gain (0 dB), 
				and midi=127 equals a +10 dB boost.
				The mapping function used for convertion from MIDI value to absolute gain is <i>amplitude = pow(midi_value*0.01,k)</i>
				where <i>k = log(pow(10.,10./20.))/log(127./100.)</i> <br />
